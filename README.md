# node-command-line-starter
Progammers are lazy. As soon as we have to do the same task over and over again we start on automizing it.
Automization is often done in the form of a command line utility.

This starter provides you with all the necessary setup to quickly create your node-command-line utility. It provides you all the
necessary setup so that you can focus on your util and don't loose time with
the project setup.

The starter also provides you all the setup for quickly pushing new versions to your npm repositiory.
